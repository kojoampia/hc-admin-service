/**
 * Thrown when a test container could not be started, carrying the diagnosis in its own message.
 *
 * <p>It exists because the failure a reader actually sees names nothing they can act on. A container
 * that does not start fails the context, and every test in every class that shares that context then
 * reports {@code IllegalState ApplicationContext failure threshold (1) exceeded: skipping repeated
 * attempt to load context for [WebMergedContextConfiguration@...]} followed by two kilobytes of
 * merged-configuration dump — no container, no image, no cause, and a list of context customizers that
 * reads like a stack trace but is not one. The real cause sits four {@code Caused by} levels down as
 * {@code ReplicaSetInitializationException: A single node replica set was not initialized in a set
 * timeout: 60 attempts}, which is itself only meaningful to somebody who already knows the answer.
 *
 * <p>Measured on jacserver at load ~47 across 16 CPUs on 2026-09-09: three integration test classes,
 * 43 errors, and not one of the 43 messages named Mongo. That is the shape backlog item 17 is about —
 * it has sent readers to {@code AuditingIT}, {@code TokenAuthenticationIT} and
 * {@code TokenAuthenticationSecurityMetersIT} for changes that touch none of them, because whichever
 * class boots the first context is the one that pays the container start and absorbs its failure.
 *
 * <p>So the message is the fix. It names the image, the attempts, the load average at the moment of
 * the failure, the window that was missed and why it cannot be widened, what to do next, and where to
 * read. The container's own exception is kept as the cause, so nothing is hidden.
