/**
 * Binds the shipped configuration files to the classes that read them.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2>
 *
 * <p>A bare {@code security:} key sat under {@code jhipster:} in {@code config/application.yml}
 * from the original 2024 generation, with nothing beneath it. Spring Boot 4.0.6 ignored it. Boot
 * 4.1 binds it as the empty String and fails, because {@code JHipsterProperties.security} is an
 * object:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   Failed to bind properties under 'jhipster' to tech.jhipster.config.JHipsterProperties:
 *     Property: jhipster.security
 *     Value: ""
 *     Reason: No setter found for property: security
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>It took the service down on the first production deploy after that upgrade, and <em>nothing in
 * this repository could have caught it</em>. The entire suite runs under the {@code test} profile
 * against {@code src/test/resources/config/application.yml}; the file that ships inside the jar is
 * only ever read by a running application. `./mvnw verify` was green throughout.
 *
 * <p>So this test reads the real files off the classpath and binds them, without starting a context
 * — no Mongo, no Consul, no Kafka. It is the cheapest thing that would have failed.
