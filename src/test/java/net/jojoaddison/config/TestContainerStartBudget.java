/**
 * How many times a test container may be started before this run gives up on it, for good.
 *
 * <p>Two things are being traded here and they pull in opposite directions.
 *
 * <p><b>Retrying helps, because the failure is a missed window rather than a broken machine.</b> A
 * loaded box misses the six-second replica-set election or the sixty-second readiness wait and the
 * next attempt, seconds later, succeeds. hc-patient shipped exactly that on 2026-09-06 (their gateway
 * PR #23) and it turned a confusing red into a slow green.
 *
 * <p><b>And retrying per class is ruinous at this repository's size, which is why theirs cannot be
 * copied unchanged.</b> {@code TestContainersSpringContextCustomizerFactory} assigns its static bean
 * only after the container has started, so a failed start leaves it null and the <em>next</em> class
 * builds a container of its own. hc-patient's gateway has four integration test classes; this service
 * has seventy-two. Measured on jacserver at load ~47 on 2026-09-09, one failing class costs about 167
 * seconds — so today a saturated run is red for something over three hours, and three attempts per
 * class would make it ten. Nobody waits for that; they kill the build and read the first stack trace,
 * which names an innocent class.
 *
 * <p>So the budget is <b>per JVM, not per class</b>. The first class to fail gets every attempt, and
 * once they are spent nothing in this run asks Docker for that container again: every later class
 * throws {@link TestContainerUnavailableException#budgetAlreadySpent} immediately, carrying the
 * original failure as its cause. A saturated run is red in minutes with a message naming the reason,
 * rather than red in hours with a message naming {@code AuditingIT}.
 *
 * <p>The cost of that choice, stated plainly: a spike that clears <em>after</em> the budget is spent
 * but <em>before</em> the run would have finished now fails the whole run where the old behaviour
 * would have recovered from the second class onwards. The budget is what bounds it — three attempts is
 * about twenty seconds on a quiet machine and about eight minutes on a saturated one, and a spike that
 * outlasts eight minutes of retrying is not a spike. Runs stay red when the machine is saturated, on
 * purpose: a retry that hides contention buys green builds by making the machine's state unreportable,
 * and this fixture is the only thing in the suite that can see it.
 *
 * <p>Not static, and holds no static state, so {@code TestContainerStartBudgetTest} can exercise the
 * latch with a fresh instance and no reset hook. The one long-lived instance lives in
 * {@link MongoDbTestContainer}.
